My function checks the BMI of a person when given their weight and height.
The weight variable is meant to be inputted in pounds.
The height variable is meant to be inputted in inches.

The function calculates the BMI using the formula (weight/(height ** 2))*703 which converts it to the metric system units.
The function will first check if the BMI is less than 18.5, if so, it will return the BMI and that the patient is underweight.
Else if the BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9, it will return you are at a healhty weight.
Else if the BMI is between 25 and 29.9, it will return you are at a overweight.
Else, it will return you are at a obese .

While testing the funciton with sample variables, the expected output is as follows:
